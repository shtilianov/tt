This sample project was built using the sample application. 

The sample application is hosted online, at http://demos.teststudio.com/sampleapp/, 
and is also included in a zip file, sampleApp.ZIP. 

This project uses the BaseURL property to direct all tests to the online 
application. If you do not have access to the Internet or cannot reach 
the sample application, follow these steps to run the appliation locally. 

* unzip sampleApp.ZIP to a directory on your computer
* from that directory, run the Mongoose application.
* modify the project settings, changing BaseURL to http://localhost:8080

For more information on the BaseURL property, see the online documentation
on Recording Options (http://www.telerik.com/automated-testing-tools/support/documentation/user-guide/project-settings/recording-options.aspx) and Running a Test
Against Multiple Environments (http://www.telerik.com/automated-testing-tools/support/documentation/user-guide/knowledge-base/test-execution/using-baseurl.aspx),
